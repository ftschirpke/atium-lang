# atium
A programming language project aimed at learning and experimentation.

More specifically, this project is not aimed at creating a programming language for use in real-world applications,
but rather a toy project where I, and potential contributors, can experiment and learn about language and compiler
related topics.

Currently, the motivations and ideas for the project are:
- build a big project using Zig
- design a modern, low-level (but not feature-complete) programming language akin to Zig and Rust
- build modern compiler using MLIR
- design a memory-safe language (similar to Rust)
    - create a borrow-checker (or something similar)
    - language design such that it restricts the programmer as little as possible
